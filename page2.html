Dileep Kumar; 6 January 1967) is an Indian music composer, record producer, singer, songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, and philanthropist[1] known for his works in Indian cinema; predominantly in Tamil and Hindi films, with occasional forays in international cinema.

Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's score for his first Hollywood film, the comedy Couples Retreat (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him Best Original Score and Best Original Song (for Jai Ho) at the 81st Academy Awards.

        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Allah Rakha Rahman[12] was born as Dileep Kumar Rajagopala in Madras, Tamil Nadu, on 6 January 1967.[13] His father, R. K. Shekhar from a Mudaliar[14][15] family, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four.[13] He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.

            After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.[16] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi),[17] Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother was summoned and was told to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school any more.[18][19]</p>

        <h2>Conversion to Islam</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Studying in Madras, Rahman graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the school.[31] Rahman was introduced to Qadiri tariqa when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. His mother was a practising Hindu.[32][33][34] At the age of 23, he converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989, changing his name to Allah Rakha Rahman (A. R. Rahman).[17][35][36][37][38]</p>

        <p>Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn.[39] He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25.[40][41][42]

            In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja.[43][44]
            
            Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India,[43] and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios.[45] Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film Yoddha, a Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.
            
            The following year, Rahman received the National Film Awards (Silver Lotus) award for Best Music Director at the 40th National Film Awards for Roja. The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme "Chinna Chinna Aasai". Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil–language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, "Chikku Bukku Rayile"), the urban Kadhalan.[46][47][48][49] Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander's Duet, which had some memorable Saxophone themes.[50][51] The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and Love Birds also drew attention.[52][53][54]
            
            Rahman attracted a Japanese audience with Muthu's success there.[55] His soundtracks are known in the Tamil Nadu film industry and abroad for his versatility in combining Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and folk-music traditions, jazz, reggae and rock music.[56][57][58][59] The soundtrack for Bombay sold 15 million copies worldwide,[60][61] and "Bombay Theme" would later reappear in his soundtrack for Deepa Mehta's Fire and a number of compilations and other media. It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film Divine Intervention and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, Lord of War. Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman's Bollywood debut.[62] Successful scores and songs for Dil Se.. and the percussive Taal followed.[63][64] Sufi mysticism inspired "Chaiyya Chaiyya" from the former film and "Zikr" from his soundtrack album for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral arrangements).[38]</p>

        <h1>Background scores</h1>
        <br>
        <p>His background scores are often characterised by the usage of subtle orchestration and ambient sounds.[89] He often employs contemporary instruments such as Guitars, Cello, Flute, Strings, Keyboard, Finger board, Harpejji, Santoor and traditional Indian instruments such as Shehnai, Sitar, Mrudangam, Veena & Tabla to create scores.

            Some of the films which fetched him appreciations for background scores include Roja, Bombay, Iruvar, Minsara Kanavu, Dil Se.., Taal, Lagaan, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, Swades, Rang De Basanti, Bose: The Forgotten Hero, Guru, Jodhaa Akbar, Raavanan, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, Rockstar, Enthiran, Kadal, Kochadaiiyaan and I.

        <h1>Musical style and influence
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Skilled in Carnatic music, Western and Hindustani classical music and the Qawwali style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahman is noted for film songs amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different musical idioms in an improvisational style.[38][136] During the 1980s Rahman recorded monaural arrangements in common with his musical predecessors, K. V. Mahadevan and Vishwanathan–Ramamoorthy. He has also worked as a pianist in Ilaiyaraaja's troupe for hundreds of movies.[137] In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology.[38][138]

            Rahman's musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an auteuristic use of counterpoint, orchestration and the human voice, melding Indian pop music with a unique timbre, form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman's music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society.[139]
            
            His first soundtrack, for Roja, was listed on Time's all-time "10 Best Soundtracks" in 2005. Film critic Richard Corliss said that the composer's "astonishing debut work parades Rahman's gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman",[140] and his initial global success is attributed to the South Asian diaspora. Music producer Ron Fair considers Rahman "one of the world's great living composers in any medium".[141]</p>
